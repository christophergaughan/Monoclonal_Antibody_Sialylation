        "**Author**: Christopher Gaughan, Ph.D.  \n",
        "**Affiliation**: Khufu Therapeutics (ML Group Lead)  \n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Current state-of-the-art computational antibody design methods, including RFdiffusion (Watson et al., 2023; Bennett et al., 2024) and related tools, face a critical limitation: **they design against de-glycosylated protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)**. This creates a fundamental disconnect between computational predictions and experimental reality:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Missing Post-Translational Modifications**: Over 70% of human proteins and most viral therapeutic targets are glycosylated, but PDB structures typically lack resolved glycans due to crystallographic challenges (flexibility, heterogeneity).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **False Positive Designs**: Antibodies that appear computationally promising may clash with glycans when tested against physiologically relevant, glycosylated targets. In the RFdiffusion antibody paper (Bennett et al., 2024), only 25% (1 out of 4) of top-scoring designs successfully bound to natively glycosylated influenza hemagglutinin.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Heterogeneity Ignored**: Real therapeutic antibodies are heterogeneous mixtures of 5-10+ major glycoforms. For CHO cell production (the most common system), only 5-15% of antibodies are sialylated, with 60-80% being G0F or G1F (asialylated or partially galactosylated) (Vattepu et al., 2022). Computational models that assume a single static structure fail to capture this biological complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Experimental Workarounds**: The RFdiffusion paper acknowledged this issue by testing designs on insect cell-expressed hemagglutinin with simplified glycosylation, rather than mammalian-expressed protein with native glycans. This avoids the problem rather than solving it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Impact\n",
        "\n",
        "This limitation reduces the experimental success rate of computationally designed antibodies and necessitates expensive screening of many candidates to find those that work on real, glycosylated targets. The pharmaceutical industry invests billions in therapeutic antibody development, and improving computational design success rates from ~25-30% to ~40-50% would have substantial economic and scientific impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Proposed Solution: Glycan-Aware Design Pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "We propose an integrated computational pipeline that explicitly models glycosylation during antibody design:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Architecture:**\n",
        "```\n",
        "1. Target Preparation\n",
        "   └─ AlphaFold3 predicts structure WITH glycans\n",
        "   └─ Model realistic glycoform distribution (G1F predominant for CHO)\n",
        "   └─ Include N297 Fc glycan for all IgG designs\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Structure-Based Design\n",
        "   └─ RFdiffusion with glycosylated target as input\n",
        "   └─ Glycans treated as fixed geometry (avoid steric clashes)\n",
        "   └─ Design CDR loops that navigate glycan shield\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Sequence Design\n",
        "   └─ ProteinMPNN generates CDR sequences\n",
        "   └─ Optimized for designed backbone geometry\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Ensemble Validation\n",
        "   └─ Test designs across glycoform distribution (G0F, G1F, G2F, G2FS1)\n",
        "   └─ Molecular dynamics simulations with explicit glycan flexibility\n",
        "   └─ MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Machine Learning Interpretability\n",
        "   └─ SHAP analysis to identify predictive features\n",
        "   └─ Quantify glycan contribution to experimental success\n",
        "   └─ Iterative improvement based on learned patterns\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Innovation**: Rather than treating glycosylation as a post-hoc validation concern, we integrate it throughout the design process, from target preparation through final validation.\n",
